        <h1>Binaural Panner Examples</h1>

        <p>This examples illustrates the use of the
            <a href="https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/binauralFIR/tree/next">BinauralPanner</a>
        to spatialize in real-time a incoming monophonic audio streams
        around the head of the listener. In this implementation, the
        binaural process simply relies on the convolution of the incoming
        audio stream with Head Related Impulse Responses (HRIRs) measured
        on a human head in free field conditions (anecho√Øc room).</p>

        <p>For implementation details and implementation alternative, see
        T. Carpentier, Binaural Synthesis with the Web Audio API, 1st Web
        Audio Conference (WAC15), Paris
        2015 <a href="http://wac.ircam.fr/pdf/demo/wac15_submission_16.pdf">PDF</a></p>

        <p>The API provides control on the positions of the sources and of
        the listener. It also proposes to download different sets of HRIRs,
        either from a server or from an URL. The public server that hosts a
        database of individual HRIRs is available for beta-testers only and
        will open to public in 2016.</p>

        <p>Here are some examples:</p>
